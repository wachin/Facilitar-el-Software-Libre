SUMMARY
Dolphin File Manager in 32-bit Debian 12 cannot access Android devices via USB

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Install Dolphin file manager 12 (32-bit version)
2. Connect an Android phone (e.g., Redmi Note 11) via USB cable
3. Attempt to access the phone through Dolphin

OBSERVED RESULT
Dolphin cannot mount or access the Android device. The device is not recognized or accessible through the file manager.

EXPECTED RESULT
Dolphin should be able to mount and access the Android device, allowing file management and transfer.

SOFTWARE/OS VERSIONS
Windows: N/A
macOS: N/A
Linux/KDE Plasma: Debian 12 (32-bit)
KDE Frameworks Versi√≥n 5.103.0
Qt Version: Qt version 5.15.8 in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The issue appears to be caused by an incorrect path in the file:
/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.kde.kmtpd5.service

The file contains the incorrect path:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libexec/kf5/kiod5

This path does not exist in 32-bit systems. The correct path should be:
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libexec/kf5/kiod5

Manually correcting this path resolves the issue, allowing Dolphin to access Android devices via USB.

This bug affects 32-bit Debian-based systems using Dolphin file manager. It may impact other 32-bit distributions as well.

A temporary workaround is to manually edit the file using a text editor with root privileges and replace the incorrect path with the correct one.

It's recommended to update the package to automatically use the correct path based on the system architecture to prevent this issue in future installations.
