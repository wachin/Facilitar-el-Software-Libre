Gutenprint Utilities</h1><div class="SECT1"><h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN570">escputil</a></h1><p>       <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escputil</i></span> is a command line utility which
allows the user to perform a variety of maintenance tasks on Epson
Stylus inkjet printers.  These tasks include head alignment, head
cleaning, nozzle check, printer identification, and retrieval of the ink
level from the printer.  In order for many of the
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escputil</i></span> functions to work, the user must have
read/write access to the raw printer device (typically /dev/lp0,
/dev/usb/lp0, and the like).  In general, these operations should be
performed by the root user.  As always, the user must insure that the
directory containing the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escputil</i></span> utility is
listed in the $PATH environment variable, or that the full path is
specified on the command line.  The examples in this section will
assume the former.

ONLY with Epson Stylus inkjet printers supported by the Gutenprint
software.  It is possible that damage MIGHT occur to your printer if
this utility is misused or if it is used with a printer other than an
Epson Stylus inkjet printer.  It is the sole responsibility of the
user to insure that this utility is suitable for the task at hand.
     </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>       In this section, specific examples of common usage will be
presented.  A summary of the command line switches can be

     </p><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN582">Determining Ink Level</a></h2><p>       Perhaps the most basic function performed by
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escputil</i></span> is that of determining the amount of ink
remaining in the printer. To do this, the user must know the name of
the raw printer device.  This is usually /dev/lp0 for a printer
connected to the parallel port, or /dev/usb/lp0 for a printer
connected to the USB.  
     </p><p>If there are multiple printers connected, one of them may be referenced as
/dev/lp1 or perhaps /dev/usb/lp1.  In the event of uncertainty, and if
CUPS is in use, view the following <a href="http://localhost:631/printers" target="_top">URL</a> 
with a web browser. At that URL, look for a line which reads "Device
URI".  The author's USB printer is listed as "Device URI:  usb:/dev/usb/lp0".
     </p><p>For this example, assume that the raw printer device is a USB printer
specified as /dev/usb/lp0.  To get the ink level for this printer,
issue this command and notice the output.

shown in the example after the "-r" switch.  Notice that the printout
shows the percent of ink remaining for each color of the author's
Epson Stylus Photo 870.  When the ink levels get too low, print
quality will suffer.  In the author's personal experience, ink levels
approaching 10% begin to cause print quality degredation, but this
will vary depending on the precise printer model.

depending on the specific error message.  If the error message is
"Invalid argument" (see following example), the problem is that the

bottom of each ink cartridge through which the ink must flow smoothly

become clogged, the printed image will show small gaps where there
should have been ink.  One can easily test for the existence of this
condition by running a nozzle check.  One need not be the root user to

printers present, the desired printer must be specified with an
additional "-P printer_name" switch, where "printer_name" is the name
of the desired printer.

lines on the paper.  Observe these lines carefully.  If there are gaps
or spaces in these lines, then the corresponding nozzle is clogged and
the print head must be cleaned.  However, if there are no gaps, the 
nozzles are clean.

some noise as it cleans the print head.  Wait until the printer is
finished cleaning the print head.  Afterwards, execute another nozzle
check and insure that the print head is indeed completely clean.  Note
that the process of cleaning the print head causes ink consumption, so
do not clean the print head any more than necessary.
     </p><p>For severely clogged nozzles, one may have to execute two or three cycles
of nozzle check followed by a cleaning of the print head.  If the
printer had gone unused for a long time, the nozzles may be so clogged
with dried ink as to be unrecoverable, in which case, the best course
of action is to replace the ink cartridge.

Please read these instructions very carefully before proceeding.

This utility lets you align the print head of your Epson Stylus 
inkjet printer.  Misuse of this utility may cause your print 
quality to degrade and possibly damage your printer.  This utility
has not been reviewed by Seiko Epson for correctness, and is 
offered with no warranty at all.  The entire risk of using this 
utility lies with you.

This utility prints 3 test patterns.  Each pattern looks very
similar.  The patterns consist of a series of pairs of vertical
lines that overlap.  Below each pair of lines is a number between 
1 and 15.

When you inspect the pairs of lines, you should find the pair
of lines that is best in alignment, that is, that best forms 
a single vertical line.  Inspect the pairs very carefully to 
find the best match.  Using a loupe or magnifying glass is 
recommended for the most critical inspection.  It is also 
suggested that you use a good quality paper for the test, so 
that the lines are well-formed and do not spread through the 
paper.  After picking the number matching the best pair, place 
the paper back in the paper input tray before typing it in.

Each pattern is similar, but later patterns use finer dots for
more critical alignment.  You must run all of the passes to 
correctly align your printer.  After running all the alignment
passes, the alignment patterns will be printed once more.  You 
should find that the middle-most pair (#8 out of the 15) is the
best for all patterns. 

After the passes are printed once more, you will be offered the
choices of (s)aving the result in the printer, (r)epeating the
process, or (q)uitting without saving.  Quitting will not restore
the previous settings, but powering the printer off and back 
on will.  If you quit, you must repeat the entire process if 
you wish to later save the results.  It is essential that you 
not turn your printer off during this procedure.

This procedure assumes that your printer is an Epson Stylus Photo
870.  If this is not your printer model, please type control-C now
and choose your actual printer model.

Please place a sheet of paper in your printer to begin the head
alignment procedure. 
Press enter to continue &gt; 
Please inspect the print, and choose the best pair of lines in 
each pattern.  Type a pair number, '?' for help, or 'r' to repeat
the procedure.
Pass #1&gt; 8
Pass #2&gt; 8
Pass #3&gt; 8
Attempting to set alignment...succeeded.
Please verify that the alignment is correct.  After the alignment
pattern is printed again, please ensure that the best pattern 
for each line is pattern 8.  If it is not, you should repeat the 
process to get the best quality printing. 
Please insert a fresh sheet of paper.
Press enter to continue &gt; 
Please inspect the final output very carefully to ensure that your
printer is in proper alignment. You may now: 
  (s)ave the results in the printer,
  (q)uit without saving the results, or
  (r)epeat the entire process from the beginning.
You will then be asked to confirm your choice.
What do you want to do (s, q, r)?
&gt; s
This will permanently alter the configuration of your printer.
WARNING: this procedure has not been approved by Seiko Epson, 
and it may damage your printer. Proceed? 
Please confirm by typing 's' again that you wish to save the 
settings to your printer: 
&gt; s
About to save settings...succeeded!
Your alignment settings have been saved to the printer.
