How can I change the OS name from Ubuntu to something else?

What Mughil said works and to make the software center work, I would do that in another way.

Sample File for lsb-release:

cat /etc/lsb-release 
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=10.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=lucid
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS"

Just change the DESCRIPTION but not ID, RELEASE and CODENAME. And also do no modify /etc/issue file.




sudo gedit /etc/lsb-release



PRETTY_NAME="MX 21.2.1 Wildflower"
DISTRIB_ID=MX
DISTRIB_RELEASE=21.2.1 
DISTRIB_CODENAME="Wildflower"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="MX 21.2.1 Wildflower"

por:

PRETTY_NAME="MX 21.2.1 Wildflower"
DISTRIB_ID=MX
DISTRIB_RELEASE=21.2.1 
DISTRIB_CODENAME="Wildflower"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="MX 21.2.1 Audio"

luego:

sudo gedit /etc/hostname

cambiar:

mx21

por

mxde21


luego

sudo grub-update
