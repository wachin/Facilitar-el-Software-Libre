This is audiokonverter, a small utility to easily
convert from MP3, AMR, OGG, AAC, M4A, FLAC, WMA, RealAudio, Musepack,
Wavpack, WAV and movies to MP3, OGG, M4A, WAV and FLAC.

For KDE3/TDE systems use installKDE3.sh!
For KDE4 systems use installKDE4.sh!
For KDE5 systems use installKDE5.sh!
On some systems you may need to use "sudo ./installKDEx.sh".
In case of double entries also remove outdated files!
If you like, copy Oggdrop-Lx.desktop to your Desktop and drop files on it.

How does it work?
There are shell scripts that will be copied to $KDEDIR/bin or $HOME/bin.
audioconvert.desktop is the KDE component that will be copied to the
right place to get an extended context menu on many files.
You can modify all files easily with any text editor.

YOU NEED to make everything work:
mplayer, ffmpeg, lame, oggenc, oggdec, flac, faac, faad, mppdec, wvunpack

OPTIONAL are:
id3lib, vorbis-tools, metaflac, apetag, id3v2

NOTES: The following formats will not be officially(!) supported due to
license issues: shorten, optimfrog, monkey.
Type 'audioconvert -h' for more info.
You can add options for lame in line 13 of audioconvert: $LAMEQUAL
