# Open with gVIM

KDE service menu which displays multiple selected files in gVIM, or VIM running in Konsole,
using separated tabs instead of opening them in buffers only. The advantage is to have all
the files immediately visible within the tabs instead of having to seek them manually in
the buffer list.

## Install

The archive contains a Makefile which can be used to install the content with ease, just
access the subfolder with the terminal and type:
```
$ make install
```

## Uninstall

To remove the installed file, just type from within the subfolder:
```
$ make uninstall
```
