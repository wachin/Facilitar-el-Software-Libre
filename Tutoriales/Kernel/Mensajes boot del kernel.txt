To view kernel messages...

dmesg

or to page through the messages...

dmesg | less

    The program helps users to print out their kernel messages. Instead of copying the messages by hand, the user only needs to enter at the console: $ dmesg > kernel.messages and mail the kernel.messages file to whoever can debug their problem.
