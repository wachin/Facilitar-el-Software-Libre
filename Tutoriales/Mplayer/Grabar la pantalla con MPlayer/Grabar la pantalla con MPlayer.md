For displaying the webcam on the desktop, I recommend mplayer.

On Ubuntu/Gnome, you can hide the window border and a little shadow as a bonus :

mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=400:height=300 -vo xv -geometry 100%:100% -noborder
# Then in the console again
T
# Press capital T to have always on top activated
