> 1\. Introduction
>
> Thank you for downloading Attracktive - a free, premium player
> instrument built on the Acktion platform.
>
> Attracktive features the same powerful engine as our Biotek organic
> synthesizer and will function as a player for our many Biotek Sound
> Packs. In addition, you'll find an ever-expanding collection of
> exclusive Attracktive libraries to explore.
>
> You no longer need the full version of Biotek to enjoy its rich sonic
> capabilities. Attracktive is the perfect tool, if you want to load and
> play Biotek presets with the ability to make minor sound adjustments.
> For extensive editing and access to all sonic functions, we recommend
> our Biotek instrument.
>
> The Attracktive user interface is designed to place a straightforward
> range of sound sculpting tools right at your fingertips. It adapts
> depending on the sound loaded in order to give you optimal control.
>
> We hope you enjoy Attracktive as much as we do. Have fun with it and
> make some great music!.

with 128 keys and two wheels. Click on a key to play the corresponding
note. The vertical position of the initial click of the key determines
the velocity. The arrows to the left and right side of the keyboard are
shown when you hover the mouse over the corresponding area and are used
to move the keyboard range that goes from C-2 to G8.

> 5.4 What is MPE?
>
> MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) is a method of using MIDI to enable
> expressive electronic musical instruments to control multiple
>
> dimensions of sound polyphonically. In MIDI, channel-wide messages
> (such as pitch bend, CCs, and channel aftertouch) are applied to all
> notes being played on a single channel; therefore, in MPE each note is
> assigned its own channel so that those messages can be applied to each
> note individually.
>
> MPE allows you to play slides easily, e.g. by playing a C3 and sliding
> up to G3. In this mode, the instrument plug-in reacts on incoming MPE
> data that is sent by an MPE Controller as for example the Roli
> Seaboard.
>
> An MPE instrument typically has three dimensions of expression /
> control --- left-right (X-axis); front-back (Y-axis); and pressure
> (Z-axis) --- each axis might be mapped to various parameters of the
> sound and be applied on a per-note basis.
>
> Not all axis movements might produce changes in a given sound. This
> depends on the choices the original sound designer made when he
> programmed the sound. At the very least, horizontal movements produce
> a pitch change.
