6.7. License

Formatted text, with synopsis.

In the header paragraph, this field gives the license information for the package as a whole, which may be different or simplified from a combination of all the per-file license information. In a Files paragraph, this field gives the licensing terms for the files listed in the Files field for this paragraph. In a stand-alone License paragraph, it gives the licensing terms for those paragraphs which reference it.

First line (synopsis): an abbreviated name for the license, or expression giving alternatives (see the Short name section for a list of standard abbreviations). If there are licenses present in the package without a standard short name, an arbitrary short name may be assigned for these licenses. These arbitrary names are only guaranteed to be unique within a single copyright file.

If there are no remaining lines, then all of the short names or short names followed by license exceptions in the synopsis must be described in stand-alone License paragraphs. Otherwise, this field should either include the full text of the license(s) or include a pointer to the license file under /usr/share/common-licenses. This field should include all text needed in order to fulfill both Debian Policy's requirement for including a copy of the software's distribution license (12.5), and any license requirements to include warranty disclaimers or other notices with the binary package.
