Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used to build a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile apps. One of the key advantages of Python is its ability to work with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) seamlessly. Python has a number of GUI frameworks that make it easy to create beautiful and functional applications.



In this article, we will explore six of the most popular Python GUI frameworks that can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple data entry forms to complex multi-touch mobile apps. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, there is a Python GUI framework that can help you build your next application. The trick is to identify which tool to use and at which stage of the development process. We understand that the process can be daunting hence reaching out to an experienced custom [**mobile app development company**](https://binmile.com/services/mobile-app-development-services/) can help smooth out the process.

Let’s move forward and have a look at these tools in greater detail.

1. **Tkinter**

Tkinter is the standard cross platform Python GUI toolkit that comes pre-installed with Python and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is a simple and easy-to-use framework that can be used to create basic GUI applications. With Tkinter, you can create buttons, labels, text boxes, menus, and other graphical components. Tkinter is ideal for building basic GUI applications, such as data entry forms, calculators, and simple games. Tkinter is not suitable for building complex or high-performance applications, as it has limited widget options and can be slow at times.

**2. PyQt**

The Qt application framework has a set of Python bindings called PyQt. Qt is a popular C++ cross-platform GUI framework that provides a wide range of widgets and features. PyQt provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for building advanced GUI applications and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. PyQt is licensed under the GPL and commercial licenses. It is built on top of the Qt application framework, which is widely used for building cross-platform desktop applications. PyQt provides a rich set of graphical components, including buttons, text boxes, sliders, and menus. It also includes advanced features such as database integration, network programming, and multithreading.

**Features of PyQT**

- Learn PyQt, which offers over 600 classes on a variety of subjects, including
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Databases in SQL
- Web toolkits
- processing XML
- Networking

**3. Kivy**

Kivy is a Python framework used for developing multi-touch applications. It is designed to work with touchscreens and provides a wide range of widgets and tools for building beautiful and responsive interfaces. Kivy can be used to build desktop, web, and mobile applications. The tool is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

**Features of Kivy**

- **Video Files:** Many modules for playing video files and streams are included with Kivy.
- **Multi-touch and gestures** — There are many widgets that support multi-touch and gestures in this system. Developers of Kivy provide a gesture library allowing users to record their own gestures.
- **UI features** — Kivy’s user interface (UI) features come in a variety of widgets and controls to improve the aesthetics and elegance of our mobile experience. Additionally, it is utilized to create new icons or design elements, dark mode, new animations, gesture navigation, and improved one-handed usage.
- **Graphical effects and OpenGL** — It quickly makes new games using PyGame. PyGame has modules for playing music, using colours, and drawing shapes.
- **Flexible** — Kivy offers greater flexibility since it can be utilized on various operating systems such as Linux, Windows, iOS, and even on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as Raspberry Pi.

\4. **PySide**

The Qt application framework can be accessed through a collection of Python bindings known as PyQt. It is similar to PyQt, but is licensed under the LGPL, which makes it more suitable for commercial applications. PySide provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for building advanced GUI applications.It is cross-platform and includes a rich set of graphical components, as well as advanced features such as database integration, network programming, and multithreading and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**5. wxPython**

wxPython serves as a Python interface to the wxWidgets C++ graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit.. wxWidgets is a mature and stable GUI framework that provides a wide range of widgets and features including support for database integration, network programming, and multithreading. wxPython is easy to use and provides a simple and consistent API. This software is designed to be compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**How to Create a GUI in Python Using WxPython?**

- Add the wx module
- Create an object for the application class
- To maintain the frame object’s layout using the panel, create an instance of the frame class and then add additional controls to it
- Then, add a Static text object to display Hello World
- The frame window is shown using the show technique
- Run the application until the window is closed by using the main event loop application object

**6. PyGTK**

PyGTK is a set of Python bindings used for the GTK+ GUI toolkit. GTK+ is a popular GUI toolkit used by a number of Linux desktop environments, such as GNOME and Xfce. PyGTK provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for building advanced GUI applications. It is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.It includes a rich set of graphical components, as well as advanced features such as database integration, network programming, and multithreading.

In conclusion, Python provides a rich set of GUI frameworks that can be used to build a wide range of desktop, web, and mobile applications. Each of these frameworks comes with its unique advantages and drawbacks. Thus, it’s crucial to select the most suitable one for your particular project. If you are not sure which one to use, you can seek advice from a [**software development consulting** company](https://binmile.com/) to help you make the best choice for your project. Whether you’re building a simple desktop application or a complex multi-touch mobile app, Python has a GUI framework that can meet your needs.
