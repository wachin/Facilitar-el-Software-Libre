sudo apt install python3-tqdm python3-bs4 sudo apt install python3-requests

Explicación
El paquete python3-bs4 es beautifulsoup4 pues dice en la descripción del paquete en synaptic: "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work."

y el paquete python3-tqdm dice: "tqdm (read taqadum, تقدّم) means “progress” in Arabic.  tqdm instantly makes
your loops show a smart progress meter, just by wrapping any iterable with
"tqdm(iterable)"."

python3-requests
elegant and simple HTTP library for Python3, built for human beings
  
Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access
the response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and urllib3, but
it does all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.
