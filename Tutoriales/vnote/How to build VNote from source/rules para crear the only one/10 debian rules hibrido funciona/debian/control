Description: Note-taking application that knows programmers and markdown better
 VNote is a Vim-inspired Note-taking application, designed 
 specially for Markdown.
 It is not yet just another Markdown editor. VNote is designed 
 to be a powerful Markdown editor with sweet note management, 
 or a note-taking application with pleasant Markdown experience.
 VNote is free and open source. You could get VNote for Linux, 
 Windows, and macOS.
 .
 Markdown, as a simple mark language, unlike rich text, was born
 with a gap between edit and read.
 There are about three ways to handle this gap:
  * As one extreme, some editors just treat Markdown as plain text.
  Users may lose themselves in the messy black characters. 
  It is hard to keep track of the information of the note.
  * Most Markdown editors use two side-by-side panels to edit 
  and preview Markdown notes simultaneously. It makes things 
  easier since users could see a pleasant typesetting and layout 
  while editing the text. However, two panels may occupy the whole
  screen and users keep moving eyes left and right, 
  which will be a big distraction.
  * As another extreme, some editors convert the Markdown elements
  in place immediately after the typing, which makes editing 
  Markdown just like editing rich text document in Word with 
  some shortcuts. 
  This may conflict with what Markdown is intended to be.
 .
 Since most editors choose the second way to handle the gap, 
 people always think of preview when it comes to Markdown. 
 It may be a MISUNDERSTANDING about Markdown. Designed as a simple
 mark language, Markdown is intended to help to keep track of
 the information of the text when editing and provide a beautiful
 typesetting when reading after being converted to HTML.
 .
 VNote tries to minimize the gap and provide the best-effort 
 WYSIWYG for Markdown via tuned syntax highlights and some other 
 features. By helping to keep track of the content, there is no
 need to preview or alter the text immediately after being typed.
 Now VNote is intended to be a pleasant note-taking platform, 
 supporting more document types in the future.
